When closing ports and sockets in network programming, several factors contribute to proper resource management, error handling, and security. In your provided code snippets for sending and receiving data over TCP sockets, a few considerations could help avoid potential issues:

send Function
Socket Creation Check: It's important to check for socket creation failure before applying socket options. Although your code checks for errors, it could be improved by moving the sock < 0 check before setsockopt. This ensures that the setsockopt calls aren't attempted on an invalid socket.
Handling Resource Leaks: If the socket is closed, ensure that the function does not return early without closing it. This can be achieved by wrapping the function logic in a resource management pattern, like using a guard to close the socket regardless of whether an error occurs.
Error Logging: Consider providing more context when errors occur. This helps in identifying the cause of the error and aids debugging.
Resource Cleanliness: In the event of an error, it's vital to clean up resources promptly. You do this effectively with close(sock), but consider using RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) patterns or scoped resource management for safety.
receive Function
Socket Overwrite: Reusing sock after the accept call can lead to confusion. Consider using a separate variable to avoid overwriting the listening socket.
Resource Management: If there's an error in accept, resources must be closed appropriately. You handle this with close(sock); however, ensure that this close doesn't unintentionally close the listening socket, rendering it unusable for further connections.
Data Buffer Handling: If the received data doesn't fully fill the buffer, ensure that the string returned to the caller only contains the valid data, excluding extra padding or garbage.
Error Handling: Use more specific error handling. For example, if recv fails due to a specific error (like EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK), ensure this is handled appropriately rather than exiting the function.
Recommendations
Use Resource Management Techniques: Consider using smart pointers or guard objects that close the socket upon function exit, regardless of success or failure.
Separate Variables: Use separate variables for different socket operations, particularly for listening sockets and client connections, to avoid confusion and unexpected closure.
Error Handling and Logging: Include more detailed logging and context for errors, providing additional information for debugging and troubleshooting.
Implementing these recommendations will enhance code robustness, reduce the chance of resource leaks, and improve maintainability and scalability
